# Leveraging Quantum Entanglement

In this tutorial, you will learn how to leverage quantum entanglement in your applications.

## Step 1: Understand Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become interconnected, and the state of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of another, regardless of distance.

## Step 2: Implement Entangled States

Use Qiskit to create and manipulate entangled states:

```python
1 from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
2 
3 def create_entangled_pair():
4     circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
5     circuit.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate
6     circuit.cx(0, 1)  # Apply CNOT gate
7     return circuit
8 
9 # Example usage
10 if __name__ == "__main__":
11     circuit = create_entangled_pair()
12     simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
13     result = execute(circuit, simulator).result()
14     print(result.get_counts())
```
