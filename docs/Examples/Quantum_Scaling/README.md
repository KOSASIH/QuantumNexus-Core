# Quantum Scaling Example

This example demonstrates how to scale quantum circuits by adding more qubits and gates.

## Overview

The script creates a quantum circuit with three qubits and applies Hadamard and CNOT gates to demonstrate scaling.

## Requirements

- `qiskit`

## Usage

Run the script to execute the quantum circuit and print the scaling results:

```bash
python scaling_example.py
```

## Conclusion
This example provides insights into how to scale quantum circuits and the implications of adding more qubits.
