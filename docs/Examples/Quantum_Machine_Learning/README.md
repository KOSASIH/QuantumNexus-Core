# Quantum Machine Learning Example

This example demonstrates how to implement a simple machine learning model using classical techniques.

## Overview

The script uses the Iris dataset to train a Random Forest classifier and evaluates its accuracy.

## Requirements

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

## Usage

Run the script to train the model and print the accuracy:

```bash
1 python ml_model.py
```

## Conclusion
This example serves as a foundation for integrating quantum algorithms with classical machine learning techniques.
