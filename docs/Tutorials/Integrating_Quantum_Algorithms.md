# Integrating Quantum Algorithms

In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate quantum algorithms into your applications using QuantumNexus-Core.

## Step 1: Choose a Quantum Algorithm

Select a quantum algorithm you want to integrate, such as Grover's or Shor's algorithm.

## Step 2: Implement the Algorithm

Create a new file for your quantum algorithm, e.g., `grovers_algorithm.py`:

```python
1 from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
2 
3 def grovers_algorithm(target):
4     # Implementation ```python
5     # of Grover's algorithm
6     circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
7     # Add quantum gates here
8     # ...
9     simulator = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
10     result = execute(circuit, simulator).result()
11     return result.get_counts()
12 
13 # Example usage
14 if __name__ == "__main__":
15     target = "01"  # Example target
16     print(grovers_algorithm(target))
```

## Step 3: Integrate with Your Application
Call the quantum algorithm from your main application code:

```python
1 from grovers_algorithm import grovers_algorithm
2 
3 result = grovers_algorithm("01")
4 print("Result from Grover's Algorithm:", result)
```
