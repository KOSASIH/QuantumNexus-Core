# Advanced Use Cases

This tutorial covers advanced use cases for QuantumNexus-Core, including multi-signature wallets and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

## Use Case 1: Multi-Signature Wallet

Create a multi-signature wallet smart contract that requires multiple approvals for transactions.

```solidity
1 pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
2 
3 contract MultiSigWallet {
4     address[] public owners;
5     uint public required;
6 
7     constructor(address[] memory _owners, uint _required) {
8         owners = _owners;
9         required = _required;
10     }
11 
12     // Add functions for transaction management
13 }
```

## Use Case 2: Decentralized Finance Application
Build a DeFi application that allows users to lend and borrow assets.

```solidity
1 pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
2 
3 contract DeFiLending {
4     mapping(address => uint) public balances;
5 
6     function lend(uint amount) public {
7         // Implementation for lending
8     }
9 
10     function borrow(uint amount) public {
11         // Implementation for borrowing
12     }
13 }
```
