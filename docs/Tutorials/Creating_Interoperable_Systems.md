# Creating Interoperable Systems

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create systems that can interact with multiple blockchain networks.

## Step 1: Understand Interoperability

Interoperability allows different blockchain networks to communicate and share data seamlessly.

## Step 2: Use Interoperability APIs

Utilize the Interoperability API to connect and transfer data between networks:

```bash
1 curl -X POST https://api.quantumnexus.com/api/interoperability/connect \
2 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
3 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
4 -d '{
5   "network": "Ethereum",
6   "credentials": {
7     "api_key": "your_api_key ",
8     "secret": "your_secret"
9   }
10 }'
```

## Step 3: Transfer Data
Once connected, you can transfer data between networks:

```bash
1 curl -X POST https://api.quantumnexus.com/api/interoperability/transfer \
2 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
3 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
4 -d '{
5   "from_network": "Ethereum",
6   "to_network": "QuantumNexus",
7   "data": "data_to_transfer"
8 }'
```

## Conclusion
You have successfully created an interoperable system that can communicate with multiple blockchain networks! Explore further integrations and functionalities in your projects.
